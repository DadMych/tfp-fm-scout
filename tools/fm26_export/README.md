# FM26 Mods on macOS (Apple Silicon) — Compatibility Fix

**BepInEx mods for Football Manager 26 on M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs.** Started as a fork of [**FM26 Player Export by vinteset**](https://www.fmscout.com/) (v5.1), grew into a full compatibility layer: native arm64 launcher, JIT-entitled shadow bundle, and a patched Il2CppInterop with an **arm64 injection scanner** — the missing piece that made *most* FM26 mods die on Apple Silicon with `GenericMethod::GetMethod not found`.

**Status: beta, community-tested.** The fixes are in the shared layer (launcher / BepInEx core / Il2CppInterop), not per-mod — so mods we've never tried should work too. Broken for you? Open an issue with your `LogOutput.log`.

## Mod compatibility

Confirmed working on Apple Silicon with this build:

| Mod | Status |
|-----|--------|
| **FM26 Display Fix** (BETA, opt-in) | 🧪 **Experimental** — 16:10 MacBooks + ultrawide; not installed by `install_macos.sh`; see [FM26 Display Fix](#fm26-display-fix) |
| **FM26 Player Export** (bundled, our fork) | ✅ Working — 700+ row exports |
| **Free Camera 1.7.0** | ✅ Working |
| **3D-LiveActionCam 2.1.1** (Event Cam) | ✅ Working — custom cams load, Harmony patches apply |

Anything using standard BepInEx APIs (`RegisterTypeInIl2Cpp`, Harmony patches, config, hotkeys) should work. Mod DLLs do **not** need to be re-signed — they're managed assemblies, macOS code signing never touches them.

**Known limitations on arm64** (logged as warnings, safe to ignore for most mods):

- `GenericMethod::GetMethod not found (arm64: likely inlined). Skipping hook` — generic methods on injected classes won't resolve (inlined in FM26's binary, nothing to hook).
- `Class::GetDefaultFieldValue skipped on arm64` — custom default values for injected enum fields won't resolve.
- `Managed detour for … skipped (MonoMod has no macOS arm64 support)` — the native detour is applied instead; Harmony patches still work because the game calls through the native side.

---

## What this fixes

| Issue on stock macOS build | Our fix |
|----------------------------|---------|
| BepInEx hooks fail under Rosetta; F9 hangs | Native **arm64** launcher (`run_bepinex_arm64.sh`) |
| Game binary lacks the JIT entitlement CoreCLR needs on Apple Silicon (BepInEx never loads, or instant crash) | Launcher auto-builds a re-signed **shadow bundle** with JIT entitlements (`~/fm26_bep/fm.app`) |
| `ClassInjector` cannot add MonoBehaviours on arm64 | **`ExportDriver`** driven by BepInEx `MainThreadTick` |
| **Other mods** using `ClassInjector.RegisterTypeInIl2Cpp` die with `GenericMethod::GetMethod not found` | Patched **Il2CppInterop** with a native **arm64 xref scanner** (upstream uses an x86-only decoder) — see `docs/il2cppinterop-arm64.patch` |
| Game quits cleanly at the main menu (no crash report), log ends with `[S_API FAIL] … before SteamAPI_Init succeeded` | Launcher exports **`SteamAppId`/`SteamGameId`** from `steam_appid.txt` so the Steam handshake succeeds deterministically |
| **16:10 / MacBook menus** leave empty space at the bottom; ultrawide has side gaps | Optional **FM26 Display Fix** (BETA) — scales UI Toolkit panels for non-16:9; install separately from `BETA/` |
| Virtualised list scroll overshoots | Scroll **one third of the viewport** per step |
| Crashes around 300–400 exported rows | Configurable **`ScrollStepDelayFrames`** (default **18**) + error **retry** |
| UITK “dirty repaint” mid-capture | Catch and retry instead of aborting |
| Empty cells in FM custom views | Read SI.Bindable text correctly |

## FM26 Display Fix

FM26 ships with **no proper support for non-16:9 displays**. On a 14" MacBook (16:10) or an ultrawide monitor, the game renders at 16:9 and macOS adds **black letterbox/pillarbox bars** around the UI — empty gaps at the bottom of menus, or dead space on the sides.

**FM26 Display Fix** lives in this repo under `BETA/` but is **not installed** by `install_macos.sh` — it is still experimental and can break UI on some screens. It is based on [LionelFW/fm26ultrawidefix](https://github.com/LionelFW/fm26ultrawidefix) (ultrawide menu scaling) and extended for **tall aspects** (16:10 MacBooks, 3:2 tablets).

### Install (opt-in)

```bash
bash build_displayfix.sh
bash install_displayfix_beta.sh
```

This stages the DLL in `~/fm26_bep/BETA/FM26DisplayFix/` (outside `BepInEx/plugins/`, so BepInEx will not load it). To enable for testing:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/fm26_bep/plugins/FM26DisplayFix
cp ~/fm26_bep/BETA/FM26DisplayFix/FM26DisplayFix.dll \
   ~/fm26_bep/plugins/FM26DisplayFix/
```

Remove `~/fm26_bep/plugins/FM26DisplayFix/` to disable again.

### What it does

1. **Forces native display aspect** — intercepts `Screen.SetResolution` so the game can't revert to 16:9 after startup. On notched MacBooks, auto-detect uses a 16:10 render size (the area macOS actually gives fullscreen apps below the menu bar).
2. **Scales UI Toolkit panels** — Harmony hook on `PanelSettings.ApplyPanelSettings` adjusts panel scale for the real screen size.
3. **Expands layout** — a polling `PanelScaler` widens elements on ultrawide and stretches vertically on 16:10, re-applied every 30 frames (FM26 resets styles on scene changes).

Match-engine camera aspect correction is optional (`PatchMatchCamera` in config).

### Verify it loaded

After launching via `run_bepinex_arm64.sh`, check `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`:

```
[Info   :FM26 Display Fix] FM26 Display Fix loaded (16:10 + ultrawide).
[Info   :FM26 Display Fix] SetResolution intercepted: 1920x1080 (...) -> 2940x1838 (FullScreenWindow)
```

If you see those lines and the menu fills your screen with no black bars, it's working.

### Known quirks

Same as the original ultrawide fix: a few main-menu elements may be slightly cropped or offset. The mod is **beta** — report screens that still have dead space in an issue with your resolution and `LogOutput.log`.

To disable without uninstalling: set `Enabled = false` in config (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).

## Requirements

- **macOS 13+** on **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- **Football Manager 26** (Steam)
- **~5 GB free disk** on your boot volume (BepInEx interop cache + export temp files)
- Terminal access (one-time setup)

**No separate BepInEx install needed** — everything is bundled: the complete BepInEx 6 IL2CPP core we test against, the doorstop injector, and all plugins. If you *do* already have stock BepInEx installed, that's fine too — the installer backs up your core DLLs to `BepInEx/core/backup-stock/` before replacing them.

---

## Installation (recommended)

### Step 1 — Run the installer

Clone or download this repo, then:

```bash
export FM26_GAME="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Football Manager 26"
# ↑ adjust if your game lives elsewhere (external SSD, etc.)

bash install_macos.sh
```

This will:

1. Install an arm64 .NET runtime, the **doorstop injector**, and the native launcher script into your game folder
2. Install the **complete matched BepInEx core** we test against, including our `MainThreadTick` patch and the **arm64-patched Il2CppInterop** (a pre-existing stock core is backed up to `BepInEx/core/backup-stock/`)
3. Install our `FM26PlayerExport.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`
4. Copy TFP view presets into `~/Library/Application Support/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 26/views/` (optional, for the export plugin)
5. Clear **Gatekeeper quarantine** on BepInEx files, doorstop, and the launcher (`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`)
6. Set **Steam launch options** for FM26 (app id `3551340`) to `run_bepinex_arm64.sh` in `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/userdata/*/config/localconfig.vdf`

> **FM26 Display Fix** is available separately under `BETA/` — not part of the main install. See [FM26 Display Fix](#fm26-display-fix).

Other mods: just drop them into `BepInEx/plugins/` as usual — no re-signing, no per-mod setup.

> **First launch takes a few minutes:** BepInEx generates Il2Cpp interop assemblies from your game install (stored under `~/fm26_bep/interop`). This happens once; later launches are fast.

> **Steam:** the installer **quits Steam automatically** before writing launch options (an open Steam client can overwrite `localconfig.vdf` on exit). Reopen Steam after install. Skip auto-config with `FM26_SKIP_STEAM_LAUNCH=1`, or keep Steam running with `FM26_SKIP_STEAM_KILL=1` (not recommended).

### Step 2 — Views: install TFP presets or make your own (for the export plugin)

FM exports only the columns visible in your current table view. You need a view with enough attributes for meaningful analysis — either use ours or build your own.

**Option A — TFP presets (recommended for [TFP FM](https://github.com/DadMych/tfp_fm), currently in development)**

Copy the bundled `.fmf` files into your FM26 views folder (Finder: **Library → Application Support → Sports Interactive → Football Manager 26 → views**):

```bash
VIEWS="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 26/views"
mkdir -p "$VIEWS"
cp views/tfp_basic_stats.fmf views/tfp_fm_squad_v1.fmf "$VIEWS/"
```

| View file | Screen in FM26 |
|-----------|----------------|
| `tfp_basic_stats.fmf` | **Player Search** / scouting shortlists |
| `tfp_fm_squad_v1.fmf` | **Squad** |

(`install_macos.sh` copies these automatically.)

**Option B — Your own view**

Create or download any FM26 view with the columns you care about (Name, Age, Position, attributes, value, etc.). Save the `.fmf` into the same `views/` folder above, or build columns in-game via **Add Column** on the table header.

Minimum for most tools: **Name + Position + ~20 known attributes**. More visible columns (fewer `-` masks) = better scores.

**Loading a view in game:** right-click the table header → **Import View** → pick the file → **Load**.

### Step 3 — Launch (Steam or manual)

The installer quits Steam (if running), sets launch options, then you reopen Steam and launch FM26 from your library.

To skip Steam auto-config: `FM26_SKIP_STEAM_LAUNCH=1 bash install_macos.sh`

**Manual launch** (if not using Steam):

```bash
cd "$FM26_GAME" && ./run_bepinex_arm64.sh
```

**Do not** use Steam’s default launch on Apple Silicon without our wrapper — it may run under Rosetta and break hooks.

### Step 4 — Export in game (Player Export plugin)

1. Open the right screen and load a view (TFP presets or your own):
   - **Squad** → `tfp_fm_squad_v1` (or any squad view with full attributes)
   - **Player Search** → `tfp_basic_stats` (or your scouting view)
2. Select players (Ctrl+A for all visible rows).
3. Press **F9** (or Ctrl+P) and **do not touch the mouse** until export finishes.
4. Find the CSV here (macOS default for **FM26 Player Export by vinteset**):

   ```
   ~/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 26/FM26PlayerExport by vinteset/Exports CSV/
   ```

   HTML copies land in `Exports HTML/` in the same folder.

   > Some guides mention `~/Documents/Sports Interactive/…` — on macOS the plugin usually writes to **`~/Sports Interactive/`** (no `Documents`). Check both if you cannot find the file.

Large lists take time: ~0.3 s per scroll step at default settings (657 rows ≈ several minutes).

## Configuration

### FM26 Display Fix (BETA)

Only applies after you opt in (see [FM26 Display Fix](#fm26-display-fix)). After first enabled launch, edit:

```
Football Manager 26/BepInEx/config/com.tfpdev.fm26displayfix.cfg
```

```ini
[General]
Enabled = true
# Force native display aspect (fixes macOS letterboxing on 16:10 MacBooks)
ForceNativeAspect = true

[Resolution]
# Override render size in pixels (0 = auto-detect; set both if auto is wrong)
Width = 0
Height = 0

[Patches]
# Correct match-engine camera aspect on non-16:9 displays
PatchMatchCamera = true

# UI element names excluded from layout expansion (comma-separated; Prefix* wildcards)
SkipExpansionElements = ModalDialog,GenericModalDialog,ExternalNewsDynamicCard
```

Set `Enabled = false` to disable without uninstalling. Delete the `.cfg` to regenerate defaults.

If auto-detect picks the wrong size (black bars on one or more sides), set both `Width` and `Height` explicitly to your display's pixel dimensions — e.g. a 14" MBP at default scaling is often `2940` × `1838` (16:10 usable area, not the raw `2940` × `1912` system size).

### FM26 Player Export

After the first export, edit:

```
Football Manager 26/BepInEx/config/com.koda.fm26.playerexport.cfg
```

```ini
[Export]
# UI hard cap is ~10000 rows
MaxRowsToExport = 10000

# Frames to wait after each scroll step (~60 fps).
# Default 18 ≈ 0.3 s/step. Raise if you still crash on long lists.
ScrollStepDelayFrames = 18
```

Delete the `.cfg` file to regenerate defaults.

## Build from source (optional)

Only needed if you change the plugin or `dist/` is missing.

```bash
export FM26_GAME="/path/to/Football Manager 26"
export FM26_BEP="$HOME/fm26_bep"   # interop cache from a prior BepInEx boot

bash build_plugin.sh
bash build_displayfix.sh          # optional — stages to BETA/, not plugins
bash install_macos.sh
bash install_displayfix_beta.sh   # optional — copy into plugins manually to test
```

Requires [.NET SDK 6+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `FM26_GAME` | Game install root |
| `FM26_BEP` | APFS cache root (default `~/fm26_bep`) |
| `FM26_INTEROP_DIR` | Il2Cpp interop assemblies (default `$FM26_BEP/interop`) |
| `FM26_CORE_DIR` | BepInEx core DLLs (default `$FM26_GAME/BepInEx/core`) |

---

## Publishing releases

Tag a version and attach `dist/` as release assets (or rely on the committed binaries in `dist/` — ~250 KB total). Point users to:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DadMych/fm26-player-export-macos.git
cd fm26-player-export-macos
FM26_GAME="/path/to/Football Manager 26" bash install_macos.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to do |
|---------|------------|
| `dyld: … libdoorstop.dylib … (have 'x86_64,arm64', need 'arm64e')`, no logs at all | Update to the latest launcher (`git pull`, re-run `install_macos.sh`). Older versions exported `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` globally, and with SIP disabled dyld tried to inject doorstop into `/usr/bin/arch` (an arm64e system binary) instead of the game. The current launcher passes DYLD vars only to the game process via `arch -e`. |
| Game exits silently right after launch, log ends after `[UnityMemory] Configuration Parameters`, no crash report | You launched the script from another directory. Steam's DRM check silently exits the game when CWD isn't the game folder. Update to the latest launcher (it does `cd` itself), or run the script from inside the game folder. |
| Game boots normally but **no BepInEx at all** (no interop, no `LogOutput.log`), or crashes instantly during load | The stock FM binary is signed by SEGA **without the JIT entitlement** that .NET CoreCLR needs on Apple Silicon, so injection either gets stripped or dies in `pthread_jit_write_protect_np`. Update to the latest launcher (`git pull`, re-run `install_macos.sh`): it now builds a re-signed "shadow" copy of the game binary (in `~/fm26_bep/fm.app`) with the JIT entitlements added, automatically, on every launch. Also check the game's own output at `/tmp/fm26_arm64_launch.log` — the launcher prints this path. |
| `[Fatal : Preloader] MissingMethodException: … BepInEx.Paths.get_DisplayBepInExVersion()` (or similar missing-method errors at boot) | Version mismatch between your BepInEx nightly and our patched DLLs. `git pull` and re-run `install_macos.sh` — it now installs the complete matched BepInEx core set instead of mixing two patched DLLs into whatever nightly you had. |
| `[Fatal : BepInEx] Unable to execute IL2CPP chainloader` + `Required target method GenericMethod::GetMethod not found`, repeating in `LogOutput.log` | BepInEx's Unity log listener calls `ClassInjector`, which cannot hook FM26's arm64 GameAssembly. Update to the latest launcher — it now forces `UnityLogListening = false` in `BepInEx.cfg` on every launch (the game sometimes regenerates the cfg with defaults). |
| A **mod** fails with `Error loading […]: … GenericMethod::GetMethod not found` (e.g. camera mods calling `RegisterTypeInIl2Cpp`) | `git pull` + re-run `install_macos.sh`. Our BepInEx core now ships a **patched Il2CppInterop** with a native arm64 xref scanner, so `ClassInjector` finds its hook targets on Apple Silicon. Two hooks are intentionally skipped on arm64 (logged as warnings): generic methods on injected classes and custom enum-field defaults won't resolve — plain class injection and Harmony patches work. |
| Game reaches the **main menu, then quits itself ~30 s later** — no crash report, `/tmp/fm26_arm64_launch.log` ends with `[S_API FAIL] Tried to access Steam interface … before SteamAPI_Init succeeded` | Steam ownership handshake failed for the direct launch. `git pull` + reinstall: the launcher now exports `SteamAppId`/`SteamGameId` from `steam_appid.txt` before starting the game. Also make sure **Steam is running and logged in** before you launch. |
| F9 does nothing | Launch via `run_bepinex_arm64.sh`, not plain Steam |
| Log stops at “Runtime invoke patched” | Rosetta path — switch to arm64 launcher |
| Crash around row 300–400 | Free disk space; set `ScrollStepDelayFrames = 24` or `30` |
| Export finishes early | Scroll the list manually before F9; ensure rows are selected |
| Empty / `-` attributes | Use a view with full attribute columns |
| `No space left on device` | BepInEx cannot flush logs or write CSV — free several GB |
| **Black bars** on all sides (letterboxing), Display Fix never loads | Steam is probably launching via stock `run_bepinex.sh` (Rosetta/x86) instead of **`run_bepinex_arm64.sh`**. In `LogOutput.log` you'll see `Process bitness: 64-bit (x64)` and the log stops at `Loading [3D-LiveActionCam]` — `FM26 Display Fix loaded` never appears. Fix: `FM26_GAME="/path/to/Football Manager 26" bash scripts/configure_steam.sh` (quits Steam, sets launch options), then relaunch from Steam. Verify log shows `Process bitness: 64-bit (ARM64)` and `FM26 Display Fix loaded`. |
| **Black bars** (letterboxing) | Display Fix is optional BETA — install from `BETA/` if you want to test. Black bars with Display Fix off are normal on 16:10 without the mod. If you enabled it and bars remain, set `Width`/`Height` in `com.tfpdev.fm26displayfix.cfg`. |
| Display Fix loads but UI looks cropped/offset | Known quirk on some screens — add element names to `SkipExpansionElements` or disable with `Enabled = false` and report in an issue |
| macOS blocks BepInEx / “damaged” dylib warnings | Re-run `install_macos.sh` (clears quarantine), or manually: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "$FM26_GAME/BepInEx" "$FM26_GAME/libdoorstop.dylib"` |
| Steam still launches without mods | Re-run `bash scripts/configure_steam.sh` with `FM26_GAME` set (it quits Steam first), or set launch options manually in FM26 Properties |

Logs: `Football Manager 26/BepInEx/LogOutput.log` — look for `[FM26Export]` or `[FM26 Display Fix]` lines.
