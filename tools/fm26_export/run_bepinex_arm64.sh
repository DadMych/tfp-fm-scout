# BepInEx launcher for FM26 running NATIVELY as arm64 (no Rosetta).
# Differences vs stock run_bepinex.sh:
#   - coreclr/corlib point to the arm64 .NET runtime (dotnet_arm64)
#   - the game is exec'd natively (NO `arch -x86_64`), so inline hooks are reliable
#
# Usage (from the game folder):
#   ./run_bepinex_arm64.sh
# or as a Steam launch option:
#   "/full/path/run_bepinex_arm64.sh" %command%

# --- JIT-entitled shadow bundle -------------------------------------------
# The stock FM binary is hardened-runtime signed by SEGA WITHOUT
# com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit, and .NET CoreCLR requires JIT on Apple
# Silicon. With plain injection the game either dies with SIGTRAP in
# pthread_jit_write_protect_np during doorstop bootstrap, or dyld refuses the
# injection entirely and the game boots without BepInEx (no logs at all).
#
# We cannot re-sign the Steam bundle in place (App Management TCC blocks it,
# and Steam restores the original file on update/verify anyway). Instead we
# build a tiny "shadow" .app on APFS: symlinks to the real Contents plus a
# copy of the main executable, ad-hoc re-signed with the original
# entitlements + the JIT ones. Rebuilt automatically whenever Steam updates
# the game binary.
